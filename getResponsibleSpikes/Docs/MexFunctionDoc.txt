% getResponsibleSpikes - Calculates the spikes responsible for the generated
% spikes.
% 
% The Syntax is as below:
% 
%     ResponsibleSpikes = getResponsibleSpikes(InputStruct)
% 
% The Input Fields required in InputStruct are:
% 
% 	N (Number of Neurons)
% 	NStart, NEnd, Weights, Delay
% 	U, V constricted to the respective time range
% 	SpikeList (constricted, note that we dont need to change the entries)
